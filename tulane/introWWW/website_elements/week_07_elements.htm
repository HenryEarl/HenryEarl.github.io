        <h2>Week 7 Website Elements Comments</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly I have to start this week by thanking the inspection tool once again. This priceless tool assisted me so many times trouble shooting style related issues. With these assignments and there step instructions, I tend to forget about the tool. But, when it comes time to style a page from scratch I rely heavily on this feature. One thing that I started noticing more this week was the caching of webpages. even though I would refresh a million times, there were times when my browser would not display the newest edit.
        </p>

        <p>
            This week I decided to change around My Elements Webpage. Jack Blitz website really put me over the edge on doing this. After reviewing his website I really liked how uniform the site is. So, I have decided to make My Elements Webpage a single continuing document. My hope is to be able to link from current weeks webpages to this elements page. I am gussing that if I name each section and link to that section it will work load the browser with that section on the viewers browser. This is going document is going to be a work in progress for me. But I think will pay dividends for the coming weeks. The process of creating another elements page and style every week just is not in my game plan. So thank you Jack for the inspiration.

           This weeks hardest tasks were setting the header image height for the Lincoln page. I wasted several hours attempting to figure this process out. The second hardest thing for me was the first of letter and sentance structure. This was particularly hard trying to get right. Once again the inspection tool helped me to figure out what rule was not being applied to the currently selected element.

        <h2>Week 8 Wesite Elements Comments</h2>
        <p>
            This week I really learned a valuable lesson. The lesson learned was that I really should use a validator soon and often. After nearly finishing the Chamberlain Calendar, I decieded it was time to check. Well that ended up leaving me with almost 200 errors to troubleshoot. I used element selectors for the individual days and weeks. My thought process during this was to have flexability when styling. Well I chose to give every day an id="x" selection and after 30+ days that turned out to be a ton of editing. I ended up abandoning that idea and used the "h3" style. In the end this gives me similar functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also learned that a good auto closing addon into my text editor is vital. I had for gotten to close the table element. This error almost made me poke my eyeballs out. I kept getting an error about with the section selector. This nearly made me quit. I resorted to searching the document and still could not find any issues. However, I decieded to erase the entire closing section element and use the auto complete utility. Thus when I used the less than symbol and the forward slash, boom, the table element closed itself. This was a valuable lesson learned as well. I am not sure how webmasters ever created webistes without these tools. I lean on them very heavily every week to complete my tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            My overall goal with this assignment again was to provide something that has visual appeal and functionality. I decided to further improve upon my "blog" style elements page and create a splash page template. This template will allow me to complete future assignments quicker. I felt that creating so many internal sites for the Chamberlain site was easy when using the same methodoligy. Overall I am quite please with the results from my work. This project compliled multiple peices from previous assignments making it suffeciently challenging and overall pleasing to complete.

        <p>
            The first thing that comes to mind during this weeks assignment is the input type="password". This was the first thing that I learned to change with my ever so favorite development inspection tool. This is always fun to show family members why browsers should not be allowed to store passwords, EVER. It is too easy to remove account passwords or even copy entire browser profiles to recover these passwords. Password managers are very easy to use and are very inexspensive. <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> is a prime example of cross platform and browser password manager.

            This weeks website is not what I deem respectable at all. I managed to throw up this weeks site at the very last minute. This made my page very boiler plate and lacking. I managed to recycle this weeks tutorial to complete the design. <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/">PCPARTPICKER</a> does a much better job of letting customers pick parts and would have preferred to mimic thier selection layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am happy with the layout of my website. I referenced week 7's website for assistance on this site. After using the template from the tutorial and changing the header image, the layout was off. Being able to refernce the syntax from the previous site allowed me to manipulate the elements that caused me issues. I was only able to complete this weeks site because of the previous weeks ground work. The ability to reuse my Splash and Elements page saved me hours. With all of my classes coming to an end, I know that I must dedicate more time to completing my websites sooner.

        This weeks challenge proved to be extra difficult. I made several attempts to get the Java applets to work. I went as far as using multiple browsers on multiple operation systems. I made attempts to install the java application on my Linux computer and get FireFox/Chromium to run the apps. I even tried them on my MacBook and still could not get the video to load.

        For my website links, I decided to seperate them by types of fractal studies. From Chaos theory, mathmatics and history. While I am still not certain on the entire background of fractal, I am very interested in the Quantum Computing. My interest in Quatum computing came around when I discovered <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/home">D-Wave,</a> a company that is leading the field in creating a quantum computer. I believe the amount of simple math functions these computer can do will forever change how we process data and crypto.

        I have recently been asked to transistion into a sales engineer role at my Managed Service company. I have found that a lot of marketing material can utilize html for emails. My hope is to learn how this actually works and impliment a system to provided a much needed customized service for my company. This class started out as introduction to html and to help further my career in security. While this class will continue to do so, I have found another need to learn this material.

            During my design of the Tree and Book webpage, I had a difficult time getting the viewport and or screen element to work correctly. I spent longer that I would like to admint retracing my foot steps in order to recover the correct style and page layout. I still to this day do not know what I did to correct the issue, but the page finally loads as exspected. I can change the screen sizes as requested.

            My second Recipe page is going to contain an actual recipe. This is my favorite desert that my wife makes for me. I highly recommend anyone that reads this page to print and attempt to make this recipe. After using a cast iron pan to bake with, definitely make bacon the next day (pro-tip).

            While trying to figure out how to Box shadow both sides of the body element, I stumbled onto a easy way to express that code. Instead of using multiple shadow styles, setting the x and y variables to 0 and using a setting a blur to a visable amount allowed me to see a shadow on both sides of the box. I am not sure why it radiates from all sides. This was learned from figure 8-3 on page 552 of our text book.

            Well the size css descriptor gave me a huge fit. I have spent three hours trying to understand it. I have not been able to find an alternative on this error. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page/size#Examples">Mozzila</a> lists this desciptor in its currents developer page. I am going to leave the "invalid" code in my page to provide page size functionality, until I find out otherwise.I also ran into a huge issue for me when I forgot to declare the media type in the html page. Basically I linked my print.css style sheet as a style sheet and did not declare the media="print". This took a while to figure out, once again thanks to Jack for posting his work early, I was able to compare our code to figure out the issue. 
        </p>
        <p>After a lot of thought, I decided to move my rotated picture to my links page. I had a very difficult time trying to style pictures that were rotated in the main webpage. So, I decided to move them to a links page and reuse a shortcut page. The fifth element for Rubic item # 7 is located on this page. This worked well for me to discover how to move an object. While I know that my skills are very novice, I feel that this was a small success that I can pat myself on the back about.</p>
        <p>
            Overall, I have learned a enourmous amount of information about how webpages are designed. I believe that I will continue to work through this to understand the basics of Java. I hope to take more classes on backend development of web applications. Thanks everyone that participated in designing thier webpages, I hope you learned something from me. I learned a lot from you!
