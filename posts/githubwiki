In the meantime, the way we recommend editing or deleting multiple files is by working with a local repository. You would then be able to delete the files in your local clone, commit that change to your local repository, and then push that change to the remote repository on GitHub.


The steps for doing this are:


In the command-line, navigate to your local repository.
Ensure you are in the default branch:
```html
git checkout master
```
The rm -r command will recursively remove your folder:
```html
git rm -r folder-name
```
Commit the change:
```html
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
```
Push the change to your remote repository:
```html
git push origin master
```
